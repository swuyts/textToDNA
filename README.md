# textToDNA
A repository for my online DNA translation tool which can be found here:
https://sanderwuyts.com/dna-decoder/

The tool is written as a Shiny app and is inspired by the work done by [Goldman et al 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11875) and the coding work done by [allanino](https://github.com/allanino/DNA)
